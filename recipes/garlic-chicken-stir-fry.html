    <p>A stir fry recipe I developed to satisfy a family of garlic lovers.</p><br>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons peanut oil</li>
        <li>6 cloves garlic minced</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon grated fresh ginger</li>

        <li>1 pound boneless skinless chicken breasts</li>

    </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat peanut oil in a wok or large skillet. When oil begins to smoke, quickly stir in 2 cloves minced garlic, ginger root, green onions and salt. Stir fry until onion becomes translucent, about 2 minutes. Add chicken and stir until opaque, about 3 minutes. Add remaining 4 cloves minced garlic and stir. Add sweet onions, cabbage, bell pepper, peas and 1/2 cup of the broth/water and cover.</li>
        <li>In a small bowl, mix the remaining 1/2 cup broth/water, soy sauce, sugar and cornstarch. Add sauce mixture to wok/skillet and stir until chicken and vegetables are coated with the thickened sauce. Serve immediately, over hot rice if desired.</li>
